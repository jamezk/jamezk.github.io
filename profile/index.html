<li>Masking of data to comply with GDPR rules imposed.</li>
<li>Provides status of dates of extraction to ensure data is not extracted more than once.</li>
<li>Retry mechanisms implemented to cope with failure.</li>

<p>An Ad-Tech company, Blis process billions of transactions per day producing 100&rsquo;s of gigabytes of data which needs to be processed and ingested into their core platform. Blis&rsquo; data pipelines were poorly implemented and managed after many years of accruing technical debt due to poorly skilled engineers producing tactical solutions in order to deliver functionality quickly. This required constant firefighting in order to keep the core systems available. I worked with a small team to introduce stability, refactoring and re-engineering core data pipelines employing TDD and continuous integration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reversal of extensive technical debt.</li>
<li>Stabilisation of data pipelines to eliminate firefighting.</li>

<li>Employed <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> to migrate across from the legacy data model and introduced <a href="https://www.elassandra.io/">Elassandra</a> to enable multi-faceted searching, removing the need for secondary indexes and reducing the number of materialised views required.</li>
<li>Comprehensive performance testing using <a href="https://gatling.io/">Gatling</a> was carried out to ensure existing SLAs were maintained and in most cases surpassed.</li>
<li>Reduced disk usage to 1.5% of the existing solution (~1TB to 18GB).</li>
<li>Planned deployment and migration steps to reduce risk with zero downtime.</li>
<li>Provided general architectural advice and governance across the organisation, reducing the risk of overly complex solutions and project failure.</li>
